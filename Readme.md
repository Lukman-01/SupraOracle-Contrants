# Solidity Smart Contract Assignments

This repository contains a series of Solidity smart contracts developed as part of a series of programming assignments. Each contract is designed with a focus on Solidity standards, security measures, and gas optimization.

## Description

The repository includes the following smart contracts:

1. **Token Sale Smart Contract**: Manages a token sale with presale and public sale phases, including features like cap on Ether raised, contribution limits, and immediate token distribution.
2. **Decentralized Voting System**: A voting system contract allowing user registration, candidate addition, and transparent, secure voting.
3. **Token Swap Smart Contract**: Facilitates swapping between two ERC-20 tokens at a predefined rate, ensuring secure and efficient exchanges.
4. **Multi-Signature Wallet**: A wallet contract requiring multiple signatures for transactions, ensuring collective control and security.

Each contract is developed using Foundry, a robust development environment for blockchain and smart contracts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Solidity
- Foundry (for contract development and testing)
- Node.js and npm (for any JavaScript-based testing or deployment scripts)

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Lukman-01/SupraOracle-Contrants.git]
   cd [SupraOracle-Contrants]
   ```

2. **Navigate to each contract folder and review the code.**

3. **Use Foundry for compiling and testing the contracts.**

### Testing

- Each contract directory contains its own set of tests. Run these tests to validate contract functionalities.
